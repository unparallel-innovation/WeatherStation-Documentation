The software for the weather station is also open-source and can be used as is, or freely customized to meet your own needs and requirements. A model for printing a 3D case for your weather station is also provided. The Unparallel Weather Station PCB simplifies the assembly of the weather station using low-cost hardware and a LoPy4 board. The LoPy4 board is equipped with several connectivity options (e.g. Sigfox, LoRa, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). Currently, the weather station uses Sigfox and/or Wi-Fi to send the data to the cloud, however, the software can be extended to support other connectivity options. The weather station uses an external sensor (AM2315) for reading temperature and relative humidity, a weather meter kit (SEN-15901) for wind speed, wind direction and precipitation. The weather station is powered from a Li-Ion battery that is charged with a photovoltaic panel which is also used to measure the approximate solar radiation. Due to the system\u2019s low-power operation and solar energy harvesting features, it is energy autonomous and can be deployed in remote places. Measured parameters: Temperature (\u00baC) Relative Humidity (%) Rainfall (mm/h) Wind Speed (km/h) Wind Gust Speed (km/h) Wind Direction (degrees) Wind Gust Direction (degrees) Solar Radiation (W/m2) Battery Voltage (V) Note: The measured solar radiation is an approximation and can vary depending on the solar panel.
