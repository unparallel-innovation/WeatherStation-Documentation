# Weather Station Enclosure Documentation
This repository contains information about how the enclosure can be assembled with the remaining material. Please follow this [link](https://unparallel-innovation.github.io/WeatherStation-Documentation/), because this represents the information available in this repository. <br> This enclosure was developed in the context of building the Unparallel Weather Station which will allows anyone to build their own low-cost weather station, using our custom open-source [PCB](https://github.com/unparallel-innovation/WeatherStation-PCB). This enclosure will protect all the connections and the PCB from weather conditions. <br>
<br>
The [software](https://github.com/unparallel-innovation/WeatherStation-Software) for the weather station is also open-source and can be used as is, or freely customized to meet your own needs and requirements.
