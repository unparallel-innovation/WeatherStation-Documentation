#Prepare the panel solar

---

<div style="text-align: justify">To prepare the solar panel, start by removing the film on the top of the panel solar. After taking it out, hold the panel like it shown below, for this also use the 3D parts which you can print, and they are available in the same enclosure repository. As the solar panel cable needs to go inside of the enclosure we propose to solder a cable to the existing one with an aproximatly size of 25 cm.  </div>
