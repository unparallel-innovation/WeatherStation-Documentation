# Adding cord rubber (optional)

---

<div style="text-align: justify">This step is optional and demonstrate that the enclosure was already prepared to take a runner cord 2mm in the enclosure as it can be seen in the figures. This will help to make it even more weather resistance. It is only used one cord across all the enclosure. If you check the following figures you will see rubber cords from different angles, but it is only to show how it fits in the different places where it will touch.</div>
